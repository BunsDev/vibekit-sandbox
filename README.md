## 🧠 What is VibeKit?

VibeKit is an SDK for running powerful coding agents like **OpenAI Codex** or **Claude Code** in secure, customizable sandboxes. You can generate and execute real code safely, stream output to your UI, and run everything locally or in the cloud — with full isolation and flexibility.
