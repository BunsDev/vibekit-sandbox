## About

Vibekit is an open source, secure and pluggable sandbox that lets developers embed OpenAI Codex and Claude Code agents into their apps.

## Features

- **Conversation History**: Pass a conversation history to the agent to continue the conversation
- **Automatic Branch Creation**: Creates a new branch with a descriptive name
- **Smart PR Metadata**: Uses AI to generate meaningful PR titles and descriptions
- **Commit Management**: Handles staging, committing, and pushing changes
- **GitHub Integration**: Creates the actual PR using GitHub's REST API
- **Agent Labeling**: Automatically labels pull requests with the agent name ('codex' or 'claude')
- **Sandbox Management**: Kill, pause, and resume sandboxes for resource optimization (Codex only)
- **Telemetry**: Supports OpenTelemetry for tracing and metrics
